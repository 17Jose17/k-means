# k-means Implementations

This repository contains different implementations and experiments related to the k-means algorithm, including:

1. A generic implementation of k-means from scratch.  
2. An implementation based on the paper **"Initialization for K-means clustering using Voronoi diagram"**.

## Repository Structure

- `generic-implementation/`: Standard implementation of the k-means algorithm.  
- `voronoi-implementation/`: Implementation based on the paper **"Initialization for K-means clustering using Voronoi diagram"**.  

## Paper Reference

The implementation in the `voronoi-implementation/` directory is based on the following article:

**Initialization for K-means clustering using Voronoi diagram**, by [Damodar Reddy and Prasanta K. Jana]. Published in [Procedia Technology], [2012].
